My assignments:
Sally   27_4C_mbnl_S19_L008     28_4D_mbnl_S20_L008

Input data lives here:
/projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/demultiplexed/

More specifically, I'll work with these files:
/projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/demultiplexed/27_4C_mbnl_S19_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz
/projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/demultiplexed/27_4C_mbnl_S19_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz
/projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/demultiplexed/28_4D_mbnl_S20_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz
/projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/demultiplexed/28_4D_mbnl_S20_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz

DO NOT move, copy, or unzip the data files!!

#figure out how to load fastqc on Talapas
module spider fastqc/0.11.5
 This module can be loaded directly: module load fastqc/0.11.5

notes from fastqc --help:
-o specifies output directory (must already exist), if not specified then output files will go to directory
that the program was run from
--extract is necessary if fastq's are zipped, but this is already set by default for command line fastqc
--threads lets you specify number of threads to run on
overall, it looks like I don't need to specify anything except maybe output (and obviously input, looks like
I just put that directly after fastqc)

fastqc_run.sh finished with exit status 0 and took 4:14.06 (m:ss) to run. Output is in

I will need to edit my per-base quality score distribution python script, because I hardcoded the values. I plan
to copy it here and change the argparse just in this folder's version, so that I can still keep track of what I
actually did in the Demultiplex assignment.

#copy per-base quality score distribution python script (from Demux assignment the first) to working directory
cd /projects/bgmp/sgrindst/bioinformatics/Bi623/QAA
cp /projects/bgmp/sgrindst/bioinformatics/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-first/qual_scores.py .

I changed the script so that it only takes in one file at a time and uses argparse instead of hardcoding file names. 

#Need to have Bioinfo module (Bioinfo.py) in working directory for python script to work.
cp /projects/bgmp/sgrindst/bioinformatics/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-first/Bioinfo.py .

Will need to use bgmp_py39 conda environment to run this script because I need matplotlib which is not in my
base conda environment.

notes from cutadapt --help:
Usage:
    cutadapt -a ADAPTER [options] [-o output.fastq] input.fastq
For paired-end reads:
    cutadapt -a ADAPT1 -A ADAPT2 [options] -o out1.fastq -p out2.fastq in1.fastq in2.fastq
Replace "ADAPTER" with the actual sequence of your 3' adapter.
I will want to use the paired-end option.
Compressed input and output is supported and
auto-detected from the file name (.gz, .xz, .bz2).

Found adapter sequences at this website: https://support.illumina.com/bulletins/2016/12/what-sequences-do-i-use-for-adapter-trimming.html

Grepped for r1 sequence in both r1 and r2 and only found it in r1. Grepped for r2 sequence in both r1 and r2 and
only found it in r2. Should I do anything else??

 Submitted batch job 16208871

Around 5% of read 1 and 0.1-0.2% of read 2 reads end up unpaired after running Trimmomatic. I'm not sure whether
to concatenate these files onto my paired files in order to use all the data for alignment in part 3 or whether
I should only carry forward the paired files. I'm leaning toward the latter because it's easier and because paired
end data should be more useful for downstream analysis, but I'm not sure what's typically done.

HTSeq-count says to use a GFF file, but GTF appears to fall under this because they say that their default
parameters are 'suitable for RNA-Seq analysis using an Ensembl GTF file.' So I will use the mus musculus GTF
that I already have downloaded.

HTSeq-count manual says I need to have a sorted sam as input so I need to install samtools in conda QAA env and
sort my sams.

conda install -c bioconda samtools
samtools --version
samtools 1.13

samtools notes from --help:
Usage: samtools view [options] <in.bam>|<in.sam>|<in.cram> [region ...]
Output options:
 -u, --uncompressed         Uncompressed BAM output (implies --bam)
This command now auto-detects the input format (BAM/CRAM/SAM).

sbatch sort_sam_run.sh 
Submitted batch job 16212388
(output in aligned directory)

#compare line counts between unsorted vs sorted files to make sure my command didn't do anything weird
wc -l 27_4C_mbnl_S19_L008_Aligned.out.sam
 14468416 27_4C_mbnl_S19_L008_Aligned.out.sam
wc -l 27_4C_mbnl_S19_L008_Aligned.sorted.sam
 14468419 27_4C_mbnl_S19_L008_Aligned.sorted.sam

There is a 3-line difference. It might not be a problem if it's just in the header section so I'm going to count
the lines not in the header section.

grep -v '^@' 27_4C_mbnl_S19_L008_Aligned.out.sam | wc -l
 14468352
grep -v '^@' 27_4C_mbnl_S19_L008_Aligned.sorted.sam | wc -l
 14468352

grep -v '^@' 28_4D_mbnl_S20_L008_Aligned.out.sam | wc -l
 24698204
grep -v '^@' 28_4D_mbnl_S20_L008_Aligned.sorted.sam | wc -l
 24698204

These numbers match so I'm going to move on for now but I should ask Pete or Leslie why this happens. I googled
it but instead found people saying that their SAMs got shorter after sorting, whereas mine got a little longer.

sbatch htseq_count_run.sh

sbatch ./analyze_htseq_count_run.sh 
Submitted batch job 16212427

HTSeq-count run with stranded=no reports an order of magnitude more reads mapping to features compared to HTSeq-count
run with stranded=yes, which shows that the RNA-seq library was not prepared with a strand-specific method.

I think the easiest way to make the read length distribution plots (end of Part 2) will be to do FASTQC again
on the trimmed files and use the data .txt files to concatenate the data, then plot in R.
